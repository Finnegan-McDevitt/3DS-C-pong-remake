# 3DS-C-pong-remake
This is a remake of the game pong I made to teach myself C for my upcoming computer architecture class at the 
University of Texas. I thought this would be a fun project to use to learn. I have not finished all the features I 
wanted to yet, and unfortunately most likely will not, but it was a good learning experience.

The library used to make this is Devkit Pro, and I have used a Makefile from one of their examples

NOTE - There is a bug where text does not appear on the top screen on emulators, and I have realised that this is 
due to most emulators not having system fonts built into them.
